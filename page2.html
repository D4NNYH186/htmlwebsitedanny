    <h2 class= "center backgroundColor">Unit 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
    <p class= "center backgroundColor"> 
        There are various aspects of IT incorporated within business models in the present day and IT has become a vital part of every business plan regardless of how small or large the company is. <br>
        In this section I will discuss some of the different ways and reasons IT is implemented in the present day marketplace.[1]<br>

        One of the more widely used aspects of IT used across businesses is email and has been for a long time, this is used in a variety of ways, whether it be communication between employees, with customers,
        suppliers and even other associates linked with the company. As time has progressed, so have the options for IT communication, various tools have evolved and are now becoming a lot more advanced, 
        VOIP (Voice over Internet protocol)/IP telephony Is one of these, this allows people to make telephone calls at any time providing there is a solid connection to the internet, <br>
        VOIP converts a users voice into a digital signal which is then sent to the other user via the internet. Another commonly used tool is live chat systems (Zendesk, Drift),<br> 
        online meeting tools and video-conferencing systems (Nasdaq meeting portal, Zoom, lifeWire) are now a key part of the operation of a business also, being used to conference with teams and management not based in the same premises.<br>
        <br>
        Moving away from communication tools we can now take a look at other aspects of IT and tools used in business looking at various management systems whether this be IMS (Inventory Management Systems) used to manage and order stock, 
        also having these connected to a POS (point of sale) system, this ensures that when an item is sold, this is reflected in the stock levels and will no longer be counted in the inventory, DMS (Data Management Systems) that store data on servers and storage devices, <br>
        that along with the introduction of ‘the cloud’ that allows users to access their data anywhere on the planet, providing they have internet access, this alleviates the use for filing cabinets and paper filing systems, MIS (Management Information Systems) 
        that can manage employee productivity, expenses, identify areas of improvement and profitability. CRM  (Customer Relationship Management) this is a way for businesses to track and manage correspondence from customers, whether it be storing emails and scanned documents to creating call logs when customers have contacted via phone. [2]

    <h2 class= "center backgroundColor">Unit 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2> 
    <p class= "center backgroundColor">Within the industry in 2019, there are a variety of skills, methods and resources that can be utilised to help complete a digital project. I would like to discuss some of these, to start I would like to touch on the kind of skills that are needed to help manage a digital project, these are 4 skills that are prime in the success of any project. Firstly, communication and collaboration. The ability to communicate well, to understand and be understood is crucial to the effectiveness of any team members working on the project.<br> If the member cannot communicate with their manager, client or team, wires will be crossed, confusion will arise which can only lead to problems for the project. [1] 
            The next skill I would like to focus on is Time management, this is essential to completing any project, If you cannot prioritise tasks and manage your time to fulfil these, then chances are your project will struggle, always be prepared and allow time for mistakes and problems, these will occur and if you do not prepare yourself for this, then when a problem does occur other tasks will fall behind, delaying the project and missing deadlines, overall decreasing productivity.
            Another crucial skill to completing a successful project is problem solving, locating problems, understanding them and devising a plan or idea on how to fix it.<br>
            Finally I would like to talk about another skill, that if not utilised will seriously damage your project, subject and product knowledge, the tech industry is consistently changing, new dev languages, gadgets, gizmos and engineering are frequently being released and updated. To be a successful developer you need to try and keep up to date with the skill set you have and would like to maintain, this doesn’t mean learning everything, but tailoring your knowledge to match the skill set needed for the project in hand. I would like to add knowing the designated brief for the project is also vital in the success for a project, if the dev does not know or understand what is needed, then how can this be delivered successfully? It cannot and therefore could derail the project. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Taking a look at methodology there seems to be two popular methods used, Agile and waterfall, ‘Agile is a much more evolved methodology, built on the backbone of flexibility and collaboration. While waterfall has a strict plan to follow, agile approaches give teams the ability to respond to change quickly and efficiently. This also allows the client or stakeholder to come in at different stages and make sure their expectations are being met before moving forward.’[2]
            There are also a variety of tools that can be utilised for the successful completion of a digital project. With the use of coding software like VS code and node.js developers can write simple code to advanced code using a variety of languages (html., JavaScript, iOs) this teamed with the use of websites like ‘Trello’ to help task management, this can be used by the entire team and helps the team on a whole see at what point each developer is at, ‘Slack’ a sharing/messaging site that has a similar layout and vaguely resembles facebook, this can be used to communicate and share ideas between team members and ‘GitHub’, which is ‘a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside’[3] other developers, this is a great platform to save and share your work, whether this be for personal gratification, or to share with a colleague.</p> 
    <br>
    <h2 class= "center backgroundColor">Unit 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2> 
    <p class= "center backgroundColor">I will plan and carry out tasks via a platform I mentioned in the previous unit, ‘Trello’. Trello offers a website with a ‘Trello board’ being the main feature, the concept is a giant to do list that helps the user to view and manage each task they have set for their project, this can be accessed by other team members if needed. I will use Trello to help me do this with my own project. As I am creating a website alongside coursework, I will set out each unit of the coursework as task and add any features, functions or design features I would like to add to my website. I have added a to do, doing and done columns on my trello board to help me situate and track to which stage I am at with my project, but have also made the additions of an idea section to add any ideas I would like to look into at a later stage providing I have my main priorities satisfied. My Trello board can be viewed <a href= "https://trello.com/b/zDhsVgjU/html-css-website-project" target="_blank">HERE</a> </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class= "center backgroundColor">Unit 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail?</h2>
    <p class= "center backgroundColor">;

            There are an array of different reasons and risks that could affect a digital project and its success. Researching this I have found that ‘70-90% of digital projects have failed to deliver what they have promised, have failed beyond minor improvements or completely flopped.CIO.com reported that 50% of companies aren’t successfully executing their digital strategies, and 20% believe that those very projects are a waste of time.’ 
            
            Accounting for business procedures, or to be more specific, failing to account for these, this is where somebody spots a problem in how something is delivered from the company, they uncover a solution to this, they sell this idea to the team and make the improvements, but the solution, while it solves the problem, it does not match the businesses procedures and strategies, then staff end up maintaining a tool that is hindering business and staff morale, staff become disengaged, bringing the company and tool further from the original goal.
            Investing in gadgets and gizmos and not customers, an example of this would be a project manager or CEO, wants a CRM system implementing because they have seen that “these are the future”. Now whilst this could be a great idea to implement, the CEO is wanting the CRM for the wrong reasons, the CEO needs to think about the problem the CRM fulfils and why one is needed within their company, business requirements and customer needs should be crucial factors to deciding on starting a project.
            Another risk is poor definition/ creating unattainable expectations, it is tempting to promise a client the world and create expectations that you cannot fulfil, leaving the project looking less and less attainable, the clients expectations need to be controlled, limit these to being clearly defined and try not to confuse the client.

    <h2 class= "center backgroundColor">Unit 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2> 
    <p class= "center backgroundColor">For this project I would select a MacBook pro, this runs on iOs, which is a much simpler Operating system, less things to go wrong and easier to navigate, I will also be using Visual Studio Code, which is a coding console, which will allow me to code in JavaScript, HTML and CSS which are the languages I need to use to produce the website, CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to help style the presentation of an HTML document, this is what is needed to stylise the website and make it look interesting and polished and HTML is used to produce the core of what is on the webpage, text, images etc. all of this combined will help me to make the project in question. I will also use a Trello board as this helps track ideas and to which stage I am at in my project and GitHub which is a code sharing platform that you can keep updated versions of your project on.
        </p> ;   
    <br>; 
    <h2 class= "center backgroundColor">Unit 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. </h2>
    <p class= "center backgroundColor">My Trello board has helped me a lot with planning, time management and keeping track of the project and what I need to get done, Trello allowed me to plan and set out what was needed in the project into bite size pieces, which was easier to track and keep on top of, this is a great tool and helps a lot with managing your time to make sure the project meets deadlines. GitHub is another great tool that should be utilised, this helped me keep the most up to date version of my code on there, which is great, because I can access and work on my code elsewhere, giving me more freedom to work on the project.</p> 
    <br>
    <h2 class= "center backgroundColor">Unit 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2> 
<div class ="backgroundColor">  
    <p class= "center">On May 25th 2019 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into legal force and effect. The regulation will take over from the Data Protection Act (1995) and is set to have an impact on individuals and businesses in all sectors globally, the digital/tech sector being one of those. [1]
            The focus of GDPR is to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches in a data-driven society. Controllers will gather and attain data and processors will use the data for purpose. 
            This will lead to various data subject rights that could impact the project:</p>
    <ul>   
         <li> Data portability- this is the right for a data candidate to receive personal data regarding them, which they have previously provided and have the right to send this data to another controller.</li>
         <li> Right to be forgotten- this is gives the candidate the right to ask for any data given to be erased and no longer used.</li>
         <li>Breach notifications- if there has been a data breach the processors have to notify their client and controllers within 72 hours from the time they first realise the breach, non-compliance can lead to large fines and penalties.[2]</li>
         </ul>
