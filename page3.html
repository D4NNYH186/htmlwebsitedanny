<h2 class= "center backgroundColor">1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>  
<p class= "center backgroundColor">At the top of my website there is a very clear and concise manner, this makes the website easy to navigate and user friendly, on the navigation bar I have split this up into an ‘About me’ section followed by the units being split on to two pages, then a ‘Reference’ page and ‘Contact’ page. On each page I have used a slightly transparent border to box in the text to make it more accessible to the user, as I have quite busy backgrounds on all my pages. At the bottom of my ‘About me’ section of the website I included an image of myself and below that embedded a video via YouTube.
        On the unit pages there is a similar layout to the other pages, the only difference being that I have included hyperlinks to jump to each unit section improving the page’s user accessibility and no images are placed other than the background image.

<h2 id= "task115" class= "center backgroundColor">1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting website</h2>
<p class= "center backgroundColor">There are various regulations and constraints that can affect the production and maintenance of a website, the first of these being Copyright Infringement, there are five exclusive rights given to copyright owners under the Copyright Act <a href= "reference.html#104" target= "_blank">[1]</a> these are as follows, the right to reproduce the copyrighted work,the right to prepare derivative works based upon the work, the right to distribute copies of the work to the public, the right to perform the copyrighted work publicly <a href= "reference.html#104" target= "_blank">[2]</a>
        If any of these are breached there can be big penalties imposed and infringer will more than likely be facing legal action as a consequence. So developers need to be very careful about reproducing another person’s work, also having the authorisation to use various images online etcAnother constraint could be Domain name concerns, this could be selecting a domain name, obtaining and registering a domain name and protecting the domain name, these are all crucial in making sure you get and keep the correct domain name relating to your site, if you have a great domain name that is easy to remember and works well for the site, the last thing you want to happen is to let the lease lapse and somebody else pick it up, leaving you having to either reclaim this back from them which can prove to be tricky or having to source another and then linking this to the marketing for your site which can also prove a lengthy and difficult process. <a href= "reference.html#104" target= "_blank">[1]</a> The final constraint I will touch on is linking and framing concerns, whether this be linking in images found on other sites, defamation, infringement or problems with frames- these are used to subdivide web pages into multiple parts, but if this is to show two pages at once this could raise copyright issues.<a href= "reference.html#104" target= "_blank">[1]</a>

    <h2 id= "task116" class= "center backgroundColor">1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them</h2>
    <p class= "center backgroundColor">There are a whole range of issues that can affect the use of the internet for people with disabilities, whether they have physical impairments (blindness, low vision, deafness) or a mental disability (motor skills, cognitive disabilities) and a range of tools that are in place to help with accessibility for these users. One of the most serious accessibility issues given how the web is currently set up, are users with visual impairments, the user could be colourblind, have low vision or no vision whatsoever, there are a few things in place to help with these problems, for low vision and color-blindness there are various accessibility solutions to this, there are various accessibility options that can be changed in the system preferences to most laptops and PC’s, these can be anything from changing colour schemes to make text and icons larger to accommodate users that do not have great vision, there are also various screen readers and audio to text converters that will help blind users read any text on screens and also input text into the system, another thing that can be done is the use of ALT attributes to provide alternative text for images which will verbalise the meaning of the picture and some of the content of it. Many users who have a Motor disability will have difficulties will complex mouse navigation and clicking alongside any complex keyboard functions, to combat this sites can be simply set out and easy to access, alleviating the need for any complex mouse movements leaving less of a chance for a user to become disorientated and lose themselves on the website.<a href= "reference.html#105" target= "_blank">[1]</a>

    <h2 id= "task117" class= "center backgroundColor">1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for website</h2>
    <p class= "center backgroundColor">For my project the two main file types utilised were .HTML and .CSS, Hypertext Markup Language or .HTML for short, is the language and file type that we use to characterise the structure of as web page,  HTML allows developers to publish documents online with headings, text, images and lists, retrieve information via hyperlinks and jumplinks and also embed videos. Cascading Style Sheets or CSS for short is a language to define the presentation of web pages with colours, layouts and various fonts, it allows the user to adapt the presentation to suit different devices and stylise the page to how they wish it to look, another aspect of this is Flexbox, a kind of add on to CSS that helps with the scaling,arrangement and placing of objects on the web site. CSS is independent on HTML and can be used with XML based languages.<a href= "reference.html#106" target= "_blank">[1]</a>
