    <h1 class= "center">About Me</h1>
    <p class= "center" class="box-sizing">My name is Daniel Heeney, I am a vocalist and artist with an invested interest in technology and web/game design. Since the age of 10 I have been quite the doodler,<br>
     but started taking art a little more seriously when I had a brief stint as a tattoo apprentice. Singing has been an interest of mine since a 4yr old singing in the <br>
     mirror and have frequented various bands throughout my life, also featuring on Popstars: The Rivals and The Voice. My interest in gaming stems from my childhood <br>
     when my father purchased an <a href= "http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/2805/Amstrad-CPC-464/" target= "_blank"> Amstrad CPC 464</a> for me, progressing on to console gaming as the years passed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class= "center">I developed an interest in coding and web design whilst spending time with a few friends that already made the jump into the tech/developing sector and industry,<br>
         I then proceeded to change careers to find a position with better working hours that would allow me to code in the evenings, I used various websites like freecodecamp.org,<br> 
         working on some of the syllabus on there.</p>
         <br>
    <p class= "center"> From then, I searched for various opportunities to take coding further and extend my knowledge of code and pick up the skills and knowledge to enter in to the industry <br>
        and sectors that I would like to work in. I came across an advertisement for codeNation on instagram, when I looked into this and spoke with the staff at the school, <br>
        this seemed like a great opportunity that I could not pass up, jumped at the chance to join the course and started as soon as I possibly could. I am hoping to gain <br>
        an apprenticeship and continue my learning on the 3 month master coding course. </p>
